# React + Vite Project Template

This project template provides a minimal setup to create a React application using Vite. It includes HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules for improved development experience and code quality.

## Features

- **Vitejs Plugins:**
  - **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md):**
    - Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh in React applications.
  - **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc):**
    - Employs [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh in React applications.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch your application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, thanks to HMR.

4. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates a production build of your application, optimized for performance and ready for deployment.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: This directory contains your application's source code.
- **`public/`**: Static assets and HTML entry point reside here.
- **`dist/`**: Output directory generated by the build command.
